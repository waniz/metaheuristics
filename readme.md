** Python algorithms and data structures **

Most of them were written while I was participating in particular competitions, 
probably for my DRY principe. 

**Algorithms:**
    - A* search;
    - BFS;
    - Simple Genetic algorithm;
    - MiniMax;
    - Alpha-beta pruning;
    
**Data structures:**
    - Directed Graph;
    - Indirected Graph;
    - Weighted Graph;
    - Game Tree;
    
**Miscellaneous:**
    - Decorators with memory (Cache);
